# CC-WebApp-Portfolio

## Description

This project is meant to demonstrate the capabilities of advanced Cascading Style Sheets.  
This project is also meant to become a working portfolio of my work as I progress through the class that will ultimately become a showcase for any hiring opportunities.  
This will be an excellent use of time in order to produce something that will remain relevant for me.  This is not some abstract project but rather a compendium of my work that will have value reflecting my effort.  

While I'm happy with this initial iteration (after scrapping the first two before completion), it would take time to create additional polish (banners, custom shapes, etc.)  
I look forward to updating this as the course continues with future projects and fleshing out this portfolio.
