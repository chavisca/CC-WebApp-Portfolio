# CC-WebApp-Portfolio

## Description

This project is meant to demonstrate the capabilities of advanced Cascading Style Sheets.  
This project is also meant to become a working portfolio of my work as I progress through the class that will ultimately become a showcase for any hiring opportunities.  
This will be an excellent use of time in order to produce something that will remain relevant for me.  This is not some abstract project but rather a compendium of my work that will have value reflecting my effort.
