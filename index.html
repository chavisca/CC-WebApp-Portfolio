            <h2>About Me</h2><br>
            <p>
                Imagine growing up in the age of computers and curiosuly exploring since the days of the IBM personal computer, playing floppy disk games as a child on a green and black monochrome screen, 
                then evolving to Windows 95 on a Packard Bell desktop with a 75mhz processor with an 8-bit color palette and experimenting with games beyond pixelated graphics.  Then comes the Windows XP era
                with 16-bit color and a young mind that is learning to write HTML during his teenage years as the internet continues to propagate and social media is being born.  That mind today is now finally taking
                the next steps in chasing his lifelong love of technology by learning to develop.

                An accountant by day, he is, of course, an advanced Microsoft Excel user.  He is no stranger to syntax, he enjoys puzzles, he is analytical in nature.  The occasional sudoku, or daily crossword puzzle,
                has not been enough to satisfy the need to solve.  Having played piano since the age of 5, taught himself guitar at 16, and has been a life-long vocalist (and former frontman of a band), music was
                the typical outlet for creation.  So what environment is ideal for an analytical, creative individual with a love for technology?  You can find the results below.
